# SimpleChat
A simple Chat Application with a Chat-Server and Chat-Client in Delphi. <br>
Use Delphi (for example the Community Version) or Lazarus to compile it.<br>
I programmed and tested it with the Community Version of Delphi.

## How to use 
Start the Chat-Server with a Port, for example with Port 8181, in your Console/Powershell: <br>
`.\chat_server_Delphi.exe 8181` <br>
The file name of the exe-file might be different, when you compile it by yourself. Just change it to your name. <br>
Now you can connect with a Client to this Server. You need the Server address and the Server port. <br>
For a localhost Server, with the Port we already used in the previous example, it looks like: <br>
`.\chat_client_Delphi localhost 8181`<br>
Open another Client in the same way in a different terminal to start Chatting between those two Clients on the Terminal. <br>
