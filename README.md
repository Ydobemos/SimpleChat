# SimpleChat
A simple Chat Application with a Chat-Server and Chat-Client in different Languages.<br>
For now in C++ and Delphi. <br>
The executable files of the different languages ​​are compatible with each other.<br>
For more information please see the ReadMe file in the corresponding folder of the programming language.

## How to use the C++ Program (in Linux or Windows)
Start the Chat-Server with a Port, for example with Port 8181, in your console/terminal: <br>
`./chat_server 8181` <br>
You might adjust the filename. So in Windows it rather looks like:<br>
`.\chat_server_cpp.exe 8181`
Now you can connect with a Client to this Server. You need the Server address and the Server port. <br>
For a localhost Server, with the Port we already used in the previous example, it looks like: <br>
`./chat_client localhost 8181` <br>
In Windows it looks like: `.\chat_client_cpp.exe localhost 8181`<br>
Open another Client in the same way in a different console/terminal to start chatting between those two Clients on the Terminal. <br>
 <br> 
 
## How to use the Delphi Program (in Windows)
Start the Chat-Server with a Port, for example with Port 8181, in your Console/Powershell: <br>
`.\chat_server_Delphi.exe 8181` <br>
The file name of the exe-file might be different, when you compile it by yourself. Just change it to your name. <br>
Now you can connect with a Client to this Server. You need the Server address and the Server port. <br>
For a localhost Server, with the Port we already used in the previous example, it looks like: <br>
`.\chat_client_Delphi localhost 8181`<br>
Open another Client in the same way in a different terminal to start Chatting between those two Clients on the Terminal. <br>
